6
00:00:42,683 --> 00:00:46,744
as we forgive those
who trespass against us.

00:00:46,854 --> 00:00:49,982
And lead us
not into temptation...

8
00:00:50,091 --> 00:00:52,958
but deliver us from evil.

[Man's Voice]
When I raise my flashing sword...

15
00:01:17,351 --> 00:01:19,911
and my hand
takes hold on judgment...

16
00:01:22,356 --> 00:01:24,756
I will take vengeance
upon mine enemies.

17
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:28,724
And I will repay those
who haste me.

18
00:01:30,197 --> 00:01:33,189
O Lord, raise me
to Thy right hand...

19
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:35,598
and count me
among Thy saints.

20
00:01:41,308 --> 00:01:44,004
And I am reminded
on this holy day...

21
00:01:45,613 --> 00:01:49,379
of the sad story
of Kitty Genovese.

22
00:01:52,119 --> 00:01:56,021
As you all may remember...

23
00:01:56,123 --> 00:01:59,149
a long time ago,
almost 30 years ago...

24
00:01:59,260 --> 00:02:03,390
this poor soul
cried out for help...

25
00:02:03,497 --> 00:02:06,022
time and time again...

26
00:02:06,133 --> 00:02:10,001
but no person
answered her calls.

27
00:02:11,805 --> 00:02:14,000
Though many saw...

28
00:02:14,108 --> 00:02:17,009
no one so much
as called the police.

29
00:02:18,812 --> 00:02:22,976
They all just watched as Kitty
was being stabbed to death...

30
00:02:24,285 --> 00:02:26,617
in broad daylight.

31
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:31,316
They watched as
her assailant walked away.

32
00:02:33,427 --> 00:02:38,023
Now, we must all fear evil men.

33
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,231
But there is
another kind of evil...

34
00:02:43,337 --> 00:02:45,965
which we must fear most...

35
00:02:48,142 --> 00:02:51,839
and that is the indifference...

36
00:02:51,946 --> 00:02:55,211

00:03:14,969 --> 00:03:18,063

- Basically, the rule of thumb here is-
- Wait. Rule of thumb?

46
00:04:49,363 --> 00:04:53,231
In the early 1900s, it was legal
for men to beat their wives...

47
00:04:53,334 --> 00:04:56,565
as long as they used a stick
no wider than their thumb.

48
00:05:03,177 --> 00:05:05,111
Can't do much damage
with that then, can we?

49
00:05:05,212 --> 00:05:07,112
Perhaps it should've been
the "rule of wrist."

would give me problems.

to the fifth.

171

Come on. Let's get out of here.
You're reachin', man.

172
00:15:24,397 --> 00:15:26,865
- It's a theory.
- I don't know. No way.

173
00:15:26,967 --> 00:15:29,834
You know how big a guy's
gotta be to do that? Fuckin' huge.

174
00:15:29,936 --> 00:15:34,168
Oh, really? I might just be
wantin' a bagel with my coffee.

175

no fuckin' bagel.

Listen, I know this neighborhood
pretty good.

named McGinty's.

- Good work, Mitchell.

195

We haven't spoken to anyone.
- D-D-Don't know.

196

He d-d-didn't say.

197

207

in the papers...

208
00:17:30,523 --> 00:17:35,460

superheroes triumphing over evil.

209
00:17:35,562 --> 00:17:38,395
Let me squash
the rumors now.

210
00:17:38,498 --> 00:17:41,092
These two are not heroes.

211
00:17:42,869 --> 00:17:45,167
They're just
two ordinary men...

212
00:17:45,271 --> 00:17:48,968

an extraordinary situation...

213
00:17:49,075 --> 00:17:51,407
and they just happened
to come out on top.

214

Yes, nothing from our
far-reaching computer system...

215

has turned up diddly
on these two.

216

All we know is what
we found out from the neighbors.

217
00:18:00,019 --> 00:18:01,919
And the general consensus is...

218
00:18:04,691 --> 00:18:06,591
they're angels.

219
00:18:09,395 --> 00:18:12,125
But angels don't kill.

220

armed and dangerous?

224

Well, not armed.

225
00:18:26,279 --> 00:18:29,806
If they had guns, they would've used them.
But dangerous? Very.

226

Now, what makes you think
they're dangerous?

00:18:31,918 --> 00:18:34,352

one way or the other.

Just be careful and go
by the protocol on this.

00:18:46,833 --> 00:18:50,166
It's grunt police work
that's gonna bring this one in.

miles away by now.

But if you wanna beat your head against
the wall, then here's what you're lookin' for.

Anything in a uniform or flashing blue lights
is gonna spook 'em.

235
00:19:01,781 --> 00:19:05,740
Okay? So the only thing we can do
is put a potato on a string...

236

South Boston.

better luck with a beer.

We met them last night.

251
00:20:14,254 --> 00:20:17,052
They had some
pretty interesting bandages.

Listen, if you want to fight,
you can see you're outnumbered here.

We're trying to be civil,
so I suggest you take our offer.

Genie says you can wish for anything you want.
He asks the Mexican what he wants.

- Nigger.

Now you Irish cops

neither of which deal
with abnormally-sized men.

Kind of makes me feel
like Riverdancing.

467
00:38:01,787 --> 00:38:05,814
Another possibility is they were
placed there with religious intent.

Okay, some cultures still put pennies
in the eyes of the dead. Or silver.

I'm sure the word you were looking for was
"symbolism." What is the symbolism there.

476
00:38:32,084 --> 00:38:34,848
Let me explain it to you.

477
00:38:34,953 --> 00:38:37,183
In Greek and Roman mythology...

478
00:38:37,289 --> 00:38:41,020
when you died, you'd have
to pay the toll to Charon...

479
00:38:41,126 --> 00:38:44,527
the boatman who ferried you
across to the Gates of Judgment.

480
00:38:44,629 --> 00:38:47,257
This made sure the dead came to
atone for what they did during their lives...

Yeah, well, I'm an expert in nameology.

484
00:38:59,678 --> 00:39:02,272
These burns indicate
that they used silencers.

485
00:39:03,782 --> 00:39:06,615
Look at these
entry and exit wounds.

486
00:39:06,718 --> 00:39:08,618
They're almost identical.

487
00:39:10,355 --> 00:39:13,518
The two bullets went in here
through the top of the skull...

488
00:39:13,625 --> 00:39:16,458
crisscrossed, and exited
through the eyeballs.

489
00:39:16,561 --> 00:39:19,394
This one clue tells us
three distinct facts.

490
00:39:19,498 --> 00:39:22,695
- Number one. Duffy?
- They shot him at a downward angle.

491
00:39:22,801 --> 00:39:28,034
- They put him on his knees?
- Excellent. Number two. Greenly.

492
00:39:28,140 --> 00:39:31,371
They shot him
at a downward angle?

493
00:39:35,380 --> 00:39:37,644
It tells us
he was the last to die.

494
00:39:39,551 --> 00:39:41,485
And number three. Dolly.

495
00:39:41,586 --> 00:39:43,486
There was two shooters.

496
00:39:43,588 --> 00:39:46,216
- Fan-freakin'-tastic.
- Hey, wait a minute.

497
00:39:46,324 --> 00:39:48,815
Stay with me, boys.
What did they do...

498
00:39:48,927 --> 00:39:50,827
to make two such
identical wounds?

499
00:39:50,929 --> 00:39:53,921
Two men of similar height
dropped this guy down.

500
00:39:54,032 --> 00:39:58,401
Each puts some iron to his head
and boom! That's all she frickin' wrote.

501
00:39:58,503 --> 00:40:01,495
- What about one guy, two guns?
- Ah, possible.

502
00:40:01,606 --> 00:40:04,200
But unlikely.
The angles are too extreme.

503
00:40:04,309 --> 00:40:07,676
A guy holding two guns to the back of
your noodle is going to shoot straight ahead.

504
00:40:07,779 --> 00:40:09,679
He wouldn't cock out his elbows.
It makes no sense.

505
00:40:09,781 --> 00:40:14,047
Besides, are you telling me
one guy came in here...

506
00:40:14,152 --> 00:40:18,088
and killed eight men with eight extremely
well-aimed shots in just a few seconds?

507
00:40:18,190 --> 00:40:20,750
No way.
It had to be at least two.

508
00:40:25,630 --> 00:40:27,530
[Scoffs]
You and your fuckin' rope.

509
00:40:39,311 --> 00:40:42,712

are you goin'?

514

Shh! I fuckin' hear
some shit out here.

515
00:41:40,772 --> 00:41:44,606
Fuck you. I'm sweatin' my ass off
draggin' your fuckin' rope around.

516
00:41:44,709 --> 00:41:46,870
- It must weigh 30 pounds.
- Shh!

517
00:41:46,978 --> 00:41:49,845
We are doin' some serious shit here.
Now, get a fuckin' hold of yourself!

518
00:41:49,948 --> 00:41:53,145
Oh, fuck you! I'm not the rope-totin'
Charlie Bronson wannabe...

519
00:41:53,251 --> 00:41:57,210
- that's gettin' us fuckin' lost.
- Would you fuckin' shut it?

520
00:41:58,557 --> 00:42:00,457
You mother-

[Together] Shepherds we shall be
for Thee, my Lord, for Thee.

524
00:42:46,671 --> 00:42:48,764
Power hath descended forth
from Thy hand.

525
00:42:48,873 --> 00:42:51,307
Our feet may swiftly
carry out Thy command.

526
00:42:51,409 --> 00:42:55,175
So we shall flow a river forth to Thee,
and teeming with souls shall it ever be.

Television.

532
00:43:50,802 --> 00:43:52,997
Television is
the explanation for this.

533
00:43:53,104 --> 00:43:56,870
You see this in bad television.

534
00:43:56,975 --> 00:44:00,376
The little assault guys creepin' through
the vents, comin' in through the ceiling.

535
00:44:00,478 --> 00:44:04,312
That James Bond shit never happens
in real life. Professionals don't do that.

536
00:44:06,284 --> 00:44:11,551
Well, name one thing you're gonna need
this stupid fuckin' rope for.

537
00:44:11,656 --> 00:44:14,523
- That was way easier than I thought.
- Aye.

538
00:44:14,626 --> 00:44:17,117
On TV, you've always got that guy
that jumps over the sofa.

539
00:44:17,228 --> 00:44:20,493
- And then you've gotta shoot him
for ten fuckin' minutes too.
- Aye.

540
00:44:20,598 --> 00:44:24,864
- Christ. We're good.
- Yes, we are.

is in that little case there?

542
00:44:34,979 --> 00:44:38,039
- Fuck me!
- Oh.

543

I'm gonna grab him by the fuckin' hair.

It's right here. Right here.

That ain't my real name.

What the fuck? Jeez!

00:45:47,152 --> 00:45:49,916

Ah, shit.

Fuck this fuckin'-
How did you two fuckin' fucks- Fuck!

575
00:46:45,743 --> 00:46:49,144
Well, that certainly illustrates
the diversity of the word.

576
00:46:53,384 --> 00:46:56,683
All these guys are Russian mob.

577
00:46:56,788 --> 00:46:59,723
But not like those two peons
in the alley the other day.

578
00:46:59,824 --> 00:47:02,725
These guys are all syndicate
bosses and underbosses.

579
00:47:02,827 --> 00:47:04,988
I have a dossier
on every man in this room.

580
00:47:07,165 --> 00:47:10,032
Since the Iron Curtain
has gone down...

581
00:47:10,134 --> 00:47:12,830
the Russian syndicates
have started to come here.

582
00:47:12,937 --> 00:47:17,135
And in the spirit of Glasnost, the Soviets
have opened their borders to the Mafia.

583
00:47:17,242 --> 00:47:20,211
But the Italians,
they aren't convinced...

584
00:47:20,311 --> 00:47:23,610
the grounds in Mother Russia are
fertile enough for organized crime yet.

585
00:47:23,715 --> 00:47:29,051
So they ain't ready to commit.
But the Russians are coming here anyway.

586
00:47:29,153 --> 00:47:31,644
They are unwelcome.

587
00:47:31,756 --> 00:47:35,522
So, what we have here,
gentlemen...

588
00:47:35,627 --> 00:47:38,425
is possibly the beginning...

589
00:47:38,529 --> 00:47:40,929
of the first
international mob war.

590
00:47:42,367 --> 00:47:45,393
Unless I've
totally missed something.

591
00:47:45,503 --> 00:47:47,903
I'm live from
the Copley Plaza Hotel...

592
00:47:48,006 --> 00:47:50,531
where we have just been informed
that the largest multiple murder...

593
00:47:50,642 --> 00:47:52,940
in Boston's history
has just taken place.

594
00:47:53,044 --> 00:47:55,137
We have learned that
there were nine victims...

595
00:47:55,246 --> 00:47:58,613
all deeply involved in a notoriously
violent Russian crime syndicate...

596
00:47:58,716 --> 00:48:00,616
right here in Boston.

597
00:48:00,718 --> 00:48:03,312
Anybody you think is evil?

598
00:48:03,421 --> 00:48:05,616
Aye.

599
00:48:05,723 --> 00:48:09,284
Don't you think
that's a little weird, a little psycho?

600
00:48:09,394 --> 00:48:11,988
Do you know what I think
is psycho, Roc?

601
00:48:15,667 --> 00:48:17,794
It's decent men
with loving families.

602
00:48:17,902 --> 00:48:20,769
They go home every day after work,
and they turn on the news.

603
00:48:20,872 --> 00:48:23,466
You know what they see?
They see rapists...

604
00:48:23,574 --> 00:48:25,667
and murderers and child molesters.

605
00:48:25,777 --> 00:48:27,677
They're all gettin' out of prison.

606
00:48:27,779 --> 00:48:30,748
Mafiosos...

607
00:48:30,848 --> 00:48:33,009
gettin' caught with 20 kilos...

608
00:48:33,117 --> 00:48:36,143
gettin' out on bail
the same fuckin' day.

609
00:48:36,254 --> 00:48:39,815
And everywhere,
everyone thinks the same thing-

610
00:48:39,924 --> 00:48:42,950
that someone should just
go kill those motherfuckers.

611
00:48:44,095 --> 00:48:47,758
Kill 'em all.
Admit it.

612
00:48:47,865 --> 00:48:50,095
Even you've thought about it.

613
00:48:53,504 --> 00:48:55,665
You guys should be
in every major city.

614
00:48:57,141 --> 00:48:59,166
This is some heavy shit.

615
00:48:59,277 --> 00:49:01,177
This is like
"Lone Ranger" heavy, man.

616
00:49:03,147 --> 00:49:07,083
Fuck it! There's so much shit
that pisses me off!

617
00:49:08,786 --> 00:49:11,653
You guys should recruit, 'cause
I'm sick and fuckin' tired...

618
00:49:11,756 --> 00:49:15,055
of walkin' down the street
waitin' for one of these crack-pipin'...

619
00:49:15,159 --> 00:49:18,526
ass-wipin', motherless
lowlifes to get me!

620
00:49:18,629 --> 00:49:20,824
Hallelujah, Jaffar.

621
00:49:20,932 --> 00:49:22,832
So you're not just talkin'
about mob guys, right?

622
00:49:22,934 --> 00:49:25,562
You're talkin' about pimps and drug dealers
and all that shit, right?

623
00:49:25,670 --> 00:49:27,399
Oh, yeah.

624
00:49:29,440 --> 00:49:32,705
Fuck. You guys could
do this every goddamn day.

625
00:49:32,810 --> 00:49:35,506
We're sort of like 7-Eleven.

626
00:49:35,613 --> 00:49:39,071
We're not always doin' business,
but we're always open.

627
00:49:39,183 --> 00:49:43,244
- Mmm. That is nicely put.
- Thank you very much.

628
00:49:52,663 --> 00:49:54,756
I will fuck you up, dude.

629
00:50:01,739 --> 00:50:04,902
So then we go right through
the fuckin' ceiling like this-
[Continues, Indistinct]

630
00:50:13,251 --> 00:50:18,553
Oh, boy. You fuckin' guys.
You ruined me.

631
00:50:18,656 --> 00:50:21,318
I'm fuckin' done.

632
00:50:21,426 --> 00:50:24,520
Permanent fuckin' package boy.

633
00:50:24,629 --> 00:50:28,622
Who said that?
You can take credit on that, you know?

634
00:50:28,733 --> 00:50:31,031
What, are you serious?

635
00:50:31,135 --> 00:50:33,035
Yeah. Fuck it.

636
00:50:34,739 --> 00:50:37,435
If you think about it,
it's all you can do, really.

637
00:50:37,542 --> 00:50:39,567
I mean, you can't go in there
and tell him it was us.

638
00:50:39,677 --> 00:50:41,645
[Conner]
Climb the corporate ladder, boy.

639
00:50:41,746 --> 00:50:44,715
Don Rocco.

640
00:50:44,816 --> 00:50:47,046
Fuck it.

641
00:50:47,151 --> 00:50:49,051
I'm doin' it. I deserve it.

642
00:50:49,153 --> 00:50:52,145
I've been workin' for those fat bastards
since I've been in high school.

643
00:50:52,256 --> 00:50:55,316
Look at this fuckin' place.
They're fuckin' me, man.

644
00:50:55,426 --> 00:50:59,590
They can suck
my pathetic little dick!

645
00:50:59,697 --> 00:51:02,188
And I'll dip my nuts
in marinara sauce...

646
00:51:02,300 --> 00:51:04,962
just so the fat bastards can get
a taste of home while they're at it.

647
00:51:05,069 --> 00:51:08,436
Fuck it!
I'm doin' it.

648
00:51:08,539 --> 00:51:11,235
It is done!
Shit!

649
00:51:11,342 --> 00:51:14,607
- Shit! Shit!
- Oh, my God!

650
00:51:17,815 --> 00:51:19,840
- What the fuck!
- I'm hit!

651
00:51:19,951 --> 00:51:21,851
Oh, fuck!

652
00:51:21,953 --> 00:51:24,183
[Rocco]
What the fuck!

653
00:51:26,591 --> 00:51:29,651
I can't believe
that just fuckin' happened!

654
00:51:29,760 --> 00:51:31,955
- Is it dead?
- Oh, my God!

655
00:51:54,585 --> 00:51:56,610
Donna's gonna be angry
about her cat.

656
00:51:56,721 --> 00:51:59,246
Shit.

657
00:51:59,357 --> 00:52:01,723
She's on every drug
known to man.

658
00:52:01,826 --> 00:52:05,193
She'd have sold the thing
for a dime bag. Screw her.

659
00:52:05,296 --> 00:52:08,265
[Laughing]

660
00:52:08,366 --> 00:52:10,732
I do kind of feel
like an asshole, though.

661
00:52:10,835 --> 00:52:13,167
Yeah, Roc, you sound
real remorseful there.

662
00:52:13,271 --> 00:52:15,330
She ain't been around
in weeks anyhow.

663
00:52:17,909 --> 00:52:20,241
Listen, something's been
botherin' me about last night.

664
00:52:20,344 --> 00:52:23,142
What?

665
00:52:23,247 --> 00:52:26,080
What if your boss knew how many fellows
were supposed to be there?

666
00:52:26,184 --> 00:52:29,210
- What are you-What are you sayin'?
- Think about it.

667
00:52:29,320 --> 00:52:31,584
Nine men, six bullets.

668
00:52:31,689 --> 00:52:34,852
Think they sold me out?
No way. No way.

669
00:52:34,959 --> 00:52:37,223
Listen, he probably knew
you'd end up nailin' the fat guy...

670
00:52:37,328 --> 00:52:39,387
maybe one or two more, but he had
to know you weren't walkin' out of there.

671
00:52:39,497 --> 00:52:41,897
Figure it out.
The shooter's dead at the scene.

672
00:52:41,999 --> 00:52:43,899
There's no in-depth investigation.

673
00:52:44,001 --> 00:52:46,367
They'll just slide right off
his fuckin' back.

674
00:52:46,470 --> 00:52:48,370
'Cause what the fuck?

675
00:52:48,472 --> 00:52:51,839
As much as I love you, man,
you are not exactly Don Corleone.

676
00:52:51,943 --> 00:52:53,843
No, no, that-

677
00:52:53,945 --> 00:52:56,106
That's just not the way things are done.
Besides, how does he know...

678
00:52:56,214 --> 00:52:59,183
I just don't get in there, see there's too many
of 'em, serve 'em their fuckin' food-

679
00:52:59,283 --> 00:53:01,251
Because he fuckin' knows you, Roc!

680
00:53:01,352 --> 00:53:04,719
A smooth hitter would have gone in there,
seen it was a fuckin' wash and slipped out.

681
00:53:04,822 --> 00:53:06,949
But you, he knows
this is your only shot.

682
00:53:07,058 --> 00:53:09,356
You've been waitin'
18 fuckin' years.

683

No. No, no.
That-That-

684
00:53:12,730 --> 00:53:15,722
That just ain't the way-
No, that's bull-That's bullshit.

685
00:53:15,833 --> 00:53:18,859
You don't know what you're talkin' about.
That's just not the way things happen.

686
00:53:18,970 --> 00:53:22,064
I mean, thanks for your concern and all,
but that just ain't the thing of it.

687
00:53:22,173 --> 00:53:24,573
Do me a favor, all right?
Just roll it around a bit on your way in.

688
00:53:24,675 --> 00:53:26,575
- Will you for me?
- No. No rollin'.

689
00:53:26,677 --> 00:53:30,044
Nothin' needs to be rolled.

Did you tell him?
- Of course I fuckin' told him.

696
00:53:47,698 --> 00:53:50,929
- Fuck you both!
- This is not a fuckin' thing you
should gamble on, all right?

697
00:53:53,037 --> 00:53:55,130
I'm the fuck out of here.

698
00:53:55,239 --> 00:53:57,139
Fine! Fuck it!

699
00:53:57,241 --> 00:53:59,971
What kind of flowers you want
at your funeral, you dumb wop?

700

- It's the last time I'm gonna see ya!
- I'll be back at nine!

Didn't I tell you, Roc?
Did they pull on you first?

723
00:55:34,372 --> 00:55:37,000
What am I doin'?
In the middle of the Lakeview!

- What?
- Where's my cat?

727
00:55:48,452 --> 00:55:51,888
I killed your cat,
you druggie bitch.

728
00:55:51,989 --> 00:55:53,422
- God. Why?
- What?

729
00:55:53,524 --> 00:55:56,186
I felt it would bring
closure to our relationship.

730
00:55:56,293 --> 00:55:59,228
- You killed my-my-
- Your what?

were all laughin' at me, man.

- Fuckin'-A right I did.

01:14:34,110 --> 01:14:36,840
This was like shootin' fish
in a friggin' barrel.

997
01:14:38,615 --> 01:14:40,742
All of 'em.

998
01:15:05,275 --> 01:15:07,334
Now these guys dove
under the table.

999
01:15:07,443 --> 01:15:11,436
The trajectory on the bullet showed that
they came from straight across.

1000
01:15:11,548 --> 01:15:14,449
So that means one of our
shooters dropped to his knees.

1001
01:15:38,541 --> 01:15:42,602
- Something went wrong right here.
- Shit! Shit! He ain't here!

1002
01:15:42,712 --> 01:15:45,374
Oh, what the fuck you mean,
he isn't here?

1003
01:15:45,481 --> 01:15:48,279
- I mean he ain't here!
- Look again, for fuck's sake!

1004
01:15:48,384 --> 01:15:50,409
I know what the fuck
he looks like!

1005
01:15:52,088 --> 01:15:54,784
Look behind ya!

1006
01:15:54,891 --> 01:15:56,791
Ah! Son of a-

1007
01:15:58,895 --> 01:16:01,523

- Shoot this motherfucker!

1009
01:16:04,233 --> 01:16:06,997
No!
Fucking let the bloke go!

1010
01:16:07,103 --> 01:16:10,004
- Let him go!
- Fuck! Jesus!

1011
01:16:10,106 --> 01:16:13,098
- Now's your chance
to earn your stripes, Roc!
- He'll fucking get killed!

1012
01:16:13,209 --> 01:16:15,143
It was your idea
to bring him in!

1013
01:16:15,244 --> 01:16:17,974
One of these guys
is a real sicko.

1014
01:16:18,081 --> 01:16:20,675
He knew this man.
He wanted him to suffer.

1015
01:16:20,783 --> 01:16:23,946
All right, Roc.
Now's your chance!

1016
01:16:24,053 --> 01:16:26,487
- You take that man!
- I don't wanna die!

- All right then.
- Fuck you, fuckin'-

1022
01:16:58,287 --> 01:17:01,552
Now take a fuckin' deep breath
there, Roc. You did fine.

1023
01:17:01,658 --> 01:17:03,558
It was nicely done.

1024
01:17:07,296 --> 01:17:10,197
They exited out the front door.

1025
01:17:10,299 --> 01:17:13,393
[Smecker]
They had no idea what they were in for.

1026
01:17:26,182 --> 01:17:29,845
Now they're starin'
at six men with guns drawn.

1027
01:17:29,952 --> 01:17:32,147
It was a fuckin' ambush.

1028
01:17:35,258 --> 01:17:37,158
This was a fuckin' bomb...

1029
01:17:37,260 --> 01:17:39,421
droppin' on Beaver Cleaverville.

1030
01:17:41,297 --> 01:17:46,257

this place was Armageddon.

with six guns?

That's the guy that got us off the hook

- And he's one smart man.
- They got nothin'.

If he hasn't figured us out yet, he will.

I've never confessed.

not "slalvation."

01:26:31,026 --> 01:26:35,019
Why have you come to a church
for counsel if you're not religious?

1112
01:26:35,130 --> 01:26:38,190
It's ethics.

1113
01:26:38,300 --> 01:26:41,565
I put evil men behind bars...

1114
01:26:41,670 --> 01:26:45,572
but the law has miles
of red tape and loopholes...

1115
01:26:45,674 --> 01:26:48,609
for these cocksuckers
to slip through.

1116
01:26:48,711 --> 01:26:52,238
I found... out
there are these two guys...

1117
01:26:52,348 --> 01:26:54,816
who fix the situation
with an iron fist...

1118
01:26:54,917 --> 01:26:56,908
as if they had God's permission.

1119
01:26:57,019 --> 01:26:59,419
God's permission?
God doesn't grant-

1120
01:26:59,521 --> 01:27:01,421
In this day and age...

1121
01:27:01,523 --> 01:27:04,083
I believe what they do
is necessary.

1122
01:27:04,193 --> 01:27:06,184
I feel it is correct.

1123
01:27:06,295 --> 01:27:08,559
A soul
is what gives us feelings.

1124
01:27:08,664 --> 01:27:11,497
It's like a conduit...

1125
01:27:11,600 --> 01:27:14,398
through which
the Lord speaks to us.

1126
01:27:14,503 --> 01:27:17,267
You felt your answers
would be here...

1127
01:27:17,373 --> 01:27:20,069
in the house
of the Lord today.

1128
01:27:20,175 --> 01:27:24,168
And you feel...
these men are necessary.

1129
01:27:26,215 --> 01:27:28,683
So the Lord has spoken to you
twice today.

1130
01:27:28,784 --> 01:27:30,684
Has He now?
[Scoffs]

1131
01:27:30,786 --> 01:27:35,450
You are the one who came into this church
speaking about beliefs and feelings.

1132
01:27:35,557 --> 01:27:39,084
Is it so hard to believe
that God has brought you here?

1133
01:27:39,194 --> 01:27:41,094
I guess not.

1134
01:27:41,196 --> 01:27:44,131
It's very easy
to be sarcastic about religion.

1135
01:27:44,233 --> 01:27:47,202
But it's much more difficult...

1136
01:27:47,303 --> 01:27:49,328
to take a stand.
[Sighs]

1137
01:27:50,773 --> 01:27:54,402
I wanna stand
for what I believe in, Father.

1138
01:27:54,510 --> 01:27:57,138
First you have to know
what your beliefs are.

1139
01:27:58,480 --> 01:28:02,849
I believe that these young men
are right.

1140
01:28:02,951 --> 01:28:06,443
- You know them personally?
- Yes.

1141
01:28:06,555 --> 01:28:10,013
Would they ever harm
an innocent person, for any reason?

1142
01:28:10,125 --> 01:28:13,219
No. They would never do that.

1143
01:28:13,329 --> 01:28:15,991
Well, the two Irish guys wouldn't.

1144
01:28:16,098 --> 01:28:18,498
The Italian guy, he might.
He's kind of an idiot.

1145
01:28:19,601 --> 01:28:22,195
I'm beginning to see.

1146
01:28:22,304 --> 01:28:25,364
All the things
I wish I could do...

1147
01:28:25,474 --> 01:28:27,965
these guys are doing.

1148
01:28:28,077 --> 01:28:31,706
W- W-What should I do?

1149
01:28:31,814 --> 01:28:35,306
Because I am a man...

1150
01:28:35,417 --> 01:28:38,250
who's supposed
to uphold the law.

1151
01:28:38,354 --> 01:28:42,154
The laws of God... are higher...

1152
01:28:42,257 --> 01:28:46,387
than the laws... of man.

1153
01:28:46,495 --> 01:28:50,761
Yes, I-I was thinking that too.
No, no. I was feeling it.

1154
01:28:50,866 --> 01:28:53,630
All I needed
was to hear you say it.

1155
01:28:55,804 --> 01:28:59,365
Amen. I will help them.

1156
01:28:59,475 --> 01:29:02,171

- Thank you, Father.

1157
01:29:05,147 --> 01:29:07,479

1324
01:41:33,962 --> 01:41:38,092
- It is your corrupt we claim.
- It is your evil that will be sought by us!

1325
01:41:38,199 --> 01:41:41,362
With every breath,
we shall hunt them down.

1326
01:41:41,469 --> 01:41:43,596
Each day we will spill their blood...

1327
01:41:43,705 --> 01:41:45,696
till it rains down from the skies!

1328
01:41:45,807 --> 01:41:49,038
Do not kill. Do not rape. Do not steal.

1329
01:41:49,144 --> 01:41:52,636
These are principles which every
man of every faith can embrace!

1330
01:41:52,747 --> 01:41:56,843
These are not polite suggestions!
These are codes of behavior...

1331
01:41:56,951 --> 01:41:59,886
and those of you that ignore
them will pay the dearest cost!

1332
01:41:59,988 --> 01:42:02,183
There are varying degrees of evil.

1333
01:42:02,290 --> 01:42:07,227
We urge you lesser forms of filth
not to push the bounds and cross over...

1334
01:42:07,328 --> 01:42:10,388
into true corruption, into our domain.

1335
01:42:10,498 --> 01:42:13,763
For if you do, one day
you will look behind you...

1336
01:42:13,868 --> 01:42:15,768
and you will see we three.

1337
01:42:15,870 --> 01:42:19,237
And on that day, you will reap it!

1338
01:42:19,340 --> 01:42:22,867
And we will send you
to whatever god you wish.

1339
01:42:27,782 --> 01:42:30,080
"And shepherds we will be,
for Thee, my Lord, for Thee.

1340
01:42:30,185 --> 01:42:32,779
"Power hath descended forth
from Thy hand...

1341
01:42:32,887 --> 01:42:35,879
- [Cursing In Italian]
- "that our feet may swiftly
carry out Thy command.

1342
01:42:35,990 --> 01:42:38,185
"So we shall flow a river forth
to Thee...

1343
01:42:38,293 --> 01:42:40,386
and teeming with souls
shall it ever be."

1344
01:42:40,495 --> 01:42:45,899
[All Ending Prayer In Latin]

1345
01:42:46,000 --> 01:42:49,333
- [Gunfire]
- [Crowd Screaming, Shouting]

1346
01:42:50,471 --> 01:42:53,372
[Screaming, Shouting Continue]

1347
01:43:02,283 --> 01:43:04,308
[Reporter]
Did you see what happened?

1348
01:43:04,419 --> 01:43:06,751
- [Crying] Yes, I was there.
- [Sirens Wailing]

1349
01:43:13,394 --> 01:43:17,091
How far are we going
to take this, Da?

1350
01:43:23,471 --> 01:43:25,803
The question is not how far.

1351
01:43:27,308 --> 01:43:32,541
The question is,
do you possess the constitution...

1352
01:43:32,647 --> 01:43:35,241
the depth of faith...

1353
01:43:35,350 --> 01:43:37,443
to go as far as is needed?

1354
01:43:41,656 --> 01:43:44,124
After the astonishing display
of vigilantism...

1355
01:43:44,225 --> 01:43:46,318
during the Yakavetta trial yesterday...

1356
01:43:46,427 --> 01:43:49,225
the largest manhunt in recent
memory is being undertaken...

1357
01:43:49,330 --> 01:43:52,731
to capture three men the media
have dubbed "the Saints."

1358
01:43:52,834 --> 01:43:56,827
This reporter went out to the street to
find out what you thought about these three.

1359
01:43:56,938 --> 01:43:59,099
Somebody can just go out,
get a gun and shoot somebody...

1360
01:43:59,207 --> 01:44:01,573
because they feel they're
doing some good in the world?

1361
01:44:01,676 --> 01:44:05,112
- No comment.
- Making the world a safer place.
- Are you kidding?

1362
01:44:05,213 --> 01:44:08,705
- They're killing for good
and only the people who kill.
- Listen to yourself.

1363
01:44:08,816 --> 01:44:10,716
This is gonna create
something so much worse.

1364
01:44:10,818 --> 01:44:14,219
- I don't think so at all.
- Well, I think you're just naive then.

1365
01:44:14,322 --> 01:44:16,290
I love the Saints, man.
They doin' a great job.

1366
01:44:16,391 --> 01:44:18,825
Keep it goin', man.
Get these murderers off the streets.

1367
01:44:18,926 --> 01:44:21,360
They're not out there
just killing for fame.

1368
01:44:21,462 --> 01:44:24,192
- They just wanna be famous.
- They should be in every major city.

1369
01:44:24,299 --> 01:44:26,199
- Every major city.
- These guys are playing God.

1370
01:44:26,301 --> 01:44:28,861
This whole religious twist.
Who do they think they are?

1371
01:44:28,970 --> 01:44:31,939
I believe in capital punishment.
If they let me, I'd pull the switch.

1372
01:44:32,040 --> 01:44:33,564
Get 'em all! Kill 'em all!

1373
01:44:33,675 --> 01:44:35,609
I'm all for it.
[Beep] them [Beep].

1374
01:44:35,710 --> 01:44:39,669
The more people they kill, the better
it is for everybody. That's what they get-

1375
01:44:39,781 --> 01:44:42,181
No, do not do that, Laquelle,
because you don't even know!

1376
01:44:42,283 --> 01:44:45,150
- Sign me up, man.
- Sign me up. All right?

1377
01:44:45,253 --> 01:44:47,881
- Where can I sign up?
- Who are they to be judge and jury?

1378
01:44:47,989 --> 01:44:51,447
- No. What if your mom sees?
- No comment.

1379
01:44:51,559 --> 01:44:53,390
- No comment.
- I'm afraid for myself.

1380
01:44:53,494 --> 01:44:55,394
I'm afraid for my kids.
I'm afraid to walk down the street.

1381
01:44:55,496 --> 01:44:57,589
I can't even believe you're
saying that. That's crazy.

1382
01:44:57,699 --> 01:44:59,599
When did you turn
into such a sissy?

1383
01:44:59,701 --> 01:45:02,636
- I think they just get off on killing people.
- Well, I have no comment.

1384
01:45:02,737 --> 01:45:05,797
- No comment on that, dear.
- I have nothing to say. Thanks.

1385
01:45:05,907 --> 01:45:08,842
All this hoopla with the media.
You guys are making it worse right now.

1386
01:45:08,943 --> 01:45:10,843
You're giving them the power.

1387
01:45:10,945 --> 01:45:13,106
By sticking that in my face,
you're giving the Saints power.

1388
01:45:13,214 --> 01:45:17,173
- I don't wanna talk about it.
- I really don't wanna talk about that.

1389
01:45:17,285 --> 01:45:19,776
You walk into some kid's bedroom,
and it's gonna be there.

1390
01:45:19,887 --> 01:45:22,515
You have Batman, Superman
and these Saints.

1391
01:45:22,623 --> 01:45:24,523
Are you losing any sleep, honey?

1392
01:45:24,625 --> 01:45:27,822
- 'Cause you know what? I'm certainly not.
- No comment.

1393
01:45:27,929 --> 01:45:31,330
- Don't talk to them.
- They're damn good. They're right!

1394
01:45:31,432 --> 01:45:33,332
I'm ready to [Beep]
my [Beep] on.

1395
01:45:33,434 --> 01:45:35,402
Okay? I'm ready to get busy too.

1396
01:45:35,503 --> 01:45:37,403
You know,
I'm ready to get busy.
